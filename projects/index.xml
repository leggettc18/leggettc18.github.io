      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grindlists is a web application designed to help gamers organize their grinding
sessions. For any readers who don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means, sometimes a game
requires a player to collect materials to complete a quest or craft an item.
Sometimes those items also require crafting intermediate items, and it can be a
lot to keep track of. The goal of Grindlists is to help gamers keep track of
what items they need, how many they need, and where those items can be found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a small educational project I wrote up to teach myself GraphQL and how to implement a
GraphQL API in Go. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; fancy, but it might be useful to someone learning GraphQL
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lenora, in the context of this website, refers to its theme. It is a theme for the
Hugo static-site generator, and is currently being used for this very site. It
utilizes TailwindCSS and a full-bleed CSS grid layout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple space shooter game written entirely in JavaScript. The goal of this
was not to make a very compelling or ground-breaking game, but to demonstrate what I believe
are best practices, based on what I was able to find online.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Devmarks is a bookmark manager intended for teams of developers to share
bookmarks to documentation, intranet sites, and other valuable information. It
is still in development so certain aspects of it are subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
