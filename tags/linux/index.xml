      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leopod is a podcast subscription organizer and player written from the ground up for Elementary OS, though
it should be usable on any Linux Desktop thanks to Flatpak. Currently you can add feeds and it will check for updates
while the app is open, and you can download and play episodes. It will also remember the last played position of an
episode you didn&amp;rsquo;t finish. The current version is 1.0.1 and a 1.1 version with some smoother UI interactions and the
ability to speed up playback is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
