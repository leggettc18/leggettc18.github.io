      <description>Grindlists is a web application designed to help gamers organize their grinding sessions. For any readers who don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means, sometimes a game requires a player to collect materials to complete a quest or craft an item. Sometimes those items also require crafting intermediate items, and it can be a lot to keep track of. The goal of Grindlists is to help gamers keep track of what items they need, how many they need, and where those items can be found.</description>
